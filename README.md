Subject: Front End Assessment Submission

Dear Hiring Manager,

I have completed the Front End Technical Support Task. Please find the links below:
- Live Page: [https://ruchika-sinha.github.io/assessment-website]
- Repository: [https://github.com/ruchika-sinha/assessment-website]

I created three interactive boxes that expand to show color and size options, matching the Figma design’s #ff6b6b color and layout, with "Bundle & Save" content from the images. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without frameworks, as requested, and included a README.md. I’m eager to discuss this and learn more about the role. Thank you!

Best regards,
Ruchika Sinha
